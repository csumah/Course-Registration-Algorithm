# Course-Registration-Algorithm
Project for CMSC 341

Developed an algorithm to prioritize student course registration based on real factors like income, utilizing a heap data structure for efficient storage. 
Implemented dynamic heap property adjustments, allowing runtime modifications between skew and leftist heaps and min-heap and max-heap configurations.
Designed an algorithm to restructure the heap efficiently when property changes are requested, ensuring optimal performance.

Implemeted program test cases to test for normal and edge scenarios, ensuring the program runs as expected.
